 Filosofia

O conhecido não é qualificado pelo conhecidor, se o conhecedor for criatura, pois conhecer não é bilateral, e boa parte das contextualizações são unilaterais, isso é bem documentado por Aristotle.
Agora para Deus as coisas são verdadeiras em relação a Deus somente, como Aquinas diz na Summa ao falar de verdade.
As coisas não são feitas de verdade.
agora indo para outro assunto, o ponto esta para linha assim como a superficie esta pro volume, mas a superficie pode ser um limite frontal, como a parede do copo em relacão ao volume, e o ponto que recebe a linha, isso aristotle fala no livro 4 de fisica 
Deus, os conceitos que ele conhece( incluinro o nada), não tem presença e sem interior, assim como o lugar, a diferença é que o lugar é em relação a um volume presente, e é presente, ainda assim ele acrescenta algo em relação ao que ele limita, é uma existencia relativa fora de si, e sozinho nada acrescenta, se for um ponto.
não tem cab8mento usar nomes negativos, mas frases sim, pois a realidade não é verbal, e os entes não são Cristo e unidade não é algo, é o mesmo que dizer que não há divisão
"560. Therefore the kind of unity which is the principle of number differs from that which is interchangeable with being; for the unity which is interchangeable with being signifies being itself, adding to it the notion of undividedness, which, since it is a negation or a privation, does not posit any reality added to being. Thus unity differs from being in no way numerically but only conceptually; for a negation or a privation is not a real being but a being of reason, as has been stated (540)."

'On the contrary, the Philosopher says (Metaph. vi) that with regard to simple things and "what a thing is," truth is "found neither in the intellect nor in things."

I answer that, As stated before, truth resides, in its primary aspect, in the intellect. Now since everything is true according as it has the form proper to its nature, the intellect, in so far as it is knowing, must be true, so far as it has the likeness of the thing known, this being its form, as knowing. For this reason truth is defined by the conformity of intellect and thing; and hence to know this conformity is to know truth. But in no way can sense know this. For although sight has the likeness of a visible thing, yet it does not know the comparison which exists between the thing seen and that which itself apprehends concerning it. But the intellect can know its own conformity with the intelligible thing; yet it does not apprehend it by knowing of a thing "what a thing is." When, however, it judges that a thing corresponds to the form which it apprehends about that thing, then first it knows and expresses truth. This it does by composing and dividing: for in every proposition it either applies to, or removes from the thing signified by the subject, some form signified by the predicate: and this clearly shows that the sense is true of any thing, as is also the intellect, when it knows "what a thing is"; but it does not thereby know or affirm truth. This is in like manner the case with complex or non-complex words. Truth therefore may be in the senses, or in the intellect knowing "what a thing is," as in anything that is true; yet not as the thing known in the knower, which is implied by the word "truth"; for the perfection of the intellect is truth as known. Therefore, properly speaking, truth resides in the intellect composing and dividing; and not in the senses; nor in the intellect knowing "what a thing is."
"Not-being has nothing in itself whereby it can be known; yet it is known in so far as the intellect renders it knowable. Hence the true is based on being, inasmuch as not-being is a kind of logical being, apprehended, that is, by reason."
"since a name has both a mode of signifying and the thing signified itself, it can always be denied of God either on account of one of these or on account of both; but it cannot be said of God except on account of only of one them. And since the truth and appropriateness of an affirmation requires that all be affirmed, whereas for the appropriateness of a negation it is sufficient if only one of them is lacking, this is why Dionysius says that negations are absolutely true, but affirmations only in some respect [secundum quid]: for only with respect to what is signified, but not with respect to the mode of signifying[23].»"
